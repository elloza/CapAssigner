"""Series-Parallel topology enumeration algorithms.

This module implements algorithms for enumerating all possible series-parallel
topologies given a set of capacitors, including both simple two-level
combinations and exhaustive SP enumeration.

This is a placeholder module created during scaffolding.
Implementation details will be added in subsequent features.
