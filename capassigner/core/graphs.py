"""Graph-based network analysis using Laplacian methods.

This module implements capacitance calculation for general (non-SP) networks
using nodal analysis with the Laplacian matrix. Handles disconnected networks,
singular matrices, and floating nodes robustly.

This is a placeholder module created during scaffolding.
Implementation details will be added in subsequent features.

    Uses nodal analysis with admittance matrix Y = sÂ·C. Solves for node

        - Detects and rejects disconnected networks
