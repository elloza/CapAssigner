"""Advanced search methods for network synthesis.

This module will implement metaheuristic algorithms (Genetic Algorithm,
Simulated Annealing, Particle Swarm Optimization) for finding optimal
capacitor network topologies when exhaustive search is impractical.

This is a placeholder module created during scaffolding.
Implementation details will be added in subsequent features (future roadmap).
