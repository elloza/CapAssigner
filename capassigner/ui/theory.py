"""Educational content and theory sections.

This module provides theory explanations, formulas, and educational content
for each synthesis method (SP exhaustive, heuristics, graph-based).

Displays content using st.latex for formulas and st.expander for
collapsible theory sections.

This is a placeholder module created during scaffolding.
Implementation details will be added in subsequent features.
